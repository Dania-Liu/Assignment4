    <p id="contributions">Stephen Gary Wozniak, known professionally as “Steve Wozniak” or “Woz”, is an American electronics engineer and a co-founder of Apple Computer alongside Steve Jobs and Ronald Wayne, born August 11, 1950, in San Jose, California. In 1974, Woz brought the world the first commercially successful personal computer, the Altair, at a small firm named MITS. Meanwhile, he also influenced the popular Macintosh, and two years later founded Apple Computer Inc. with his Apple I personal computer. His next success came the following year where he introduced his Apple II personal computer, featuring a central processing unit, a keyboard, colour graphics, and a floppy disk drive. He is now listed as the sole inventor of four Apple patents and has earned ten Honorary Doctor of Engineering degrees throughout the years. His career has explored various business and philanthropic ventures regarding computer capabilities in schools and experiential learning that encourages creativity and innovation by students. He is satisfied with the outcome of his career as he states that his “goal wasn’t to make a ton of money, it was to build good computers.” Finally, he has adopted the Los Gatos School District after making significant investments of both his time and resources in education.</p>
